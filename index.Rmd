description: If open data is the new gold, why even those who release fail to reuse
  it?   We created an open collaboration of data curators and open-source developers
  to dig into novel open data sources or increase the usability of existing ones.  We
  turn reproducible research software into research- as-service.

# Big Data for All {-}

**We want to make sure that every individual research, artists, professional, NGO, small and large organization can take equal benefit in the era of big data from artificial intelligence.** 

Big data creates injustices, because it is the big corporations, big government agencies and the biggest, best endowed universities that can finance long-lasting, comprehensive data collection. Big data, and large, well-processed, tidy and imputed datasets allow them to unleash the power of machine learning and AI. They create algorithms that decide the commercial success of your product, your artwork, gives them a competitive edge against smaller competitors and helps them evade regulations.

We are looking for partners to develop our [technological solution](#app) in [financially sustainable way](service) with bringing more and more relevant, [curated](#data-curators) open data [to light](#open-data). Our Product/Market Fit was validated in the world’s 2nd ranked university-backed incubator program, the [Yes!Delft AI Validation Lab](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/). We are currently developing this project with the help of the [JUMP European Music Market Accelerator](https://www.jumpmusic.eu/fellow2021/automated-music-observatory/) program.

## How We Add Value To Your Data? {- #data-value-added}

Many countries in the world allow access to a vast array of information,
such as documents under freedom of information requests, statistics,
datasets. In the European Union, most taxpayer financed data in
government administration, transport, or meteorology, for example, can
be usually re-used. More and more scientific output is expected to be
reviewable and reproducible, which implies open access.

- In the \@ref(open-data). [Open Data](#open-data) chapter we investigate why not even those organizations, like the European Commission, use open data in their own data dissemination practices, who make them at least legally available. The idea of open data is that it can reduce your material data costs, because it gives you access to data that was created at your tax expense by governmental agencies or universities. The problem main problem with *open data* is that while it is legally accessible, and often cost-free, it in most cases not findable, and not even accessible directly. While the EU has policies since 2003 about making taxpayer funded data reusable, it did not make much technical steps to make this a reality.  Reusability of governmental data and scientific data is a right, but not a practical possiblity for most users.

- In the \@ref(FAIR-data). [FAIR Data and the Added Value of Rich Metadata](#FAIR-data) we introduce how we apply the concept of [FAIR](#FAIR) (**f**indable, **a**ccessibe, **i**nteroperable, and **r**eusable of digital assets) in our APIs. Metadata does not relate to material data acquistion costs, but in fact, it is probably even more important: it is responsible for your non-billable hours, or the uncredited working hours in academia. Poor data documentation, lack of reproducible processing and testing logs, inconsistent use of currencies, keywords, and storing [messy data](#messy-data) makes reusability impossible. Organization pay many times for the same, repeated work, because these boring tasks, which often comprise of tens of thousands of microtasks, are neglected. Our solution creates automatic documentation and metadata, if necessary, to your own historica internal data or acquisitions from data vendors. We apply the more general [Dublin Core](#Dublin-Core) and the more specific, mandatory and recommended values of [DataCite](#DataCite) for datasets -- these are new requirements in EU funded research from 2021. But they are just the minimal steps, and there is a lot more to do to create a diamond ring from an uncut gem.

- In the \@ref(app). [Application: Automated Data Observatories](#app) chapter we provide further technical information about our application. We use open-source software and open data. The applications are hosted on the cloud resources of [Reprex](#reprex), an early-stage technology startup currently building a viable, open-source, open-data business model to create reproducible research products. Our development team works on an open collaboration basis. Our indicator R packages, and our services are developed together with [rOpenGov](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/ropengov/).

- See \@ref(service). [Service Design and Business Case Development](#service) we lay out our ideas about finding a suitable business model for data sharing, and shared research activities that maintains the fairly shares the exponential value added from data integration across various business, policy, and academic partners.

- The \@ref(data-curators). [Data Curators](#data-curators) chapter we give information for prospective curators.  See also our [get inspired](#get-inspired) and [your first contribution](#first-contribution) subchapters.

## Big Data For All {-}

Machine learning and AI gives a competitive edge for large companies and governments that can exploit it.  But training algorithms requires much, uniformly formatted, high quality data, and algorithms come with many potential side effects.

## Automated Data Observatories {- #data-observatory}

We are working around the open collaboration concept, which is well-known in open source software development and reproducible science, but we try to make this agile project management methodology more inclusive, and include data curators, and various institutional partners into this approach. Based around our early-stage startup, Reprex, and the open-source developer community rOpenGov, we are working together with other developers, data scientists, and domain specific data experts in climate change and mitigation, antitrust and innovation policies, and various aspects of the music and film industry.
